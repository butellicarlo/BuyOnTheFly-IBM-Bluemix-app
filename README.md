# BuyOnTheFly Web Application

### Intro
The project has been made for a class at the University and represents an application (online store) that allows all the subscribed users to sell (and
buy) items fastly and in their local area.
A user (seller) who wants to give away old items, he will be able to sell them.
A user (buyer) will be able to check all the available items around him checking
prices and gets notified when a new item is available

It is made by using *Node.js* and based on the *Express framework* (that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications).
It also uses Gmail API:
- to send email to all the users in the same location when an item is available.
- to receive email when users want to contact an operator to ask something
